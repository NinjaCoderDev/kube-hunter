# KHV001 - Pod With Mount To /var/log

## issue description

Kubernetes uses `/var/log/pods` on nodes to store Pods log files. When running `kubectl logs` the kubelet is fetching the pod logs from that directory. If a container has write access to `/var/log` it can create arbitrary files, or symling to other files on the host, that will be executed by the kubelet when a use executes `kubectl log`.

## remediation

Consider disallowing writable host mounts to `/etc/log`.
